## Install nvim

Oficial site: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim

Feel free to install the way you want, I like to use `asdf` to install and manage my neovim.

* To install asdf I cloned the repo and source it in my `~/.bash_profile`. The how to guide and many other options are available [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_2-download-asdf)
* Install [asdf-neovim plugin](https://github.com/richin13/asdf-neovim) (`asdf plugin add neovim`)
* You can list the neovim versions available with `asdf list-all neovim` 
* And install one specific version or the stable or nightly builds
* My current setup:
** `asdf install neovim 0.7.2`
** `asdf global neovim 0.7.2` 

After that, you can open the neovim typing: `nvim` in your prompt.
